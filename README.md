# Console-Finances

##Challenges

I found it relatively easy to display a heaer, line break and ---- into the console. I then found it relatively simple to calculate the total months. However, calculating the net total amount of profit/losses was too difficult for me to comprehend. I researching many ways to do this and although I understood how to access the j column in the array, I couldn't solve how to add each digit. I tried sum and array.reduce in different ways but cannot identify a working solution. I realised that I needed help so I requested a tutor and I also asked my peers. A peer gave me a hint which helped me to udnerstand that I was using the correct coe, but that I had got something in the wrong order. Eventually, I identified that I had the console/log in the wrong place and this fixed the problem.
