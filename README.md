# Console-Finances

##Challenges

I found it relatively easy to display a heaer, line break and ---- into the console. I then found it relatively simple to calculate the total months. However, calculating the net total amount of profit/losses was too difficult for me to comprehend. I researching many ways to do this and although I understood how to access the j column in the array, I couldn't solve how to add each digit. I tried sum and array.reduce in different ways but cannot identify a working solution. I realised that I needed help so I requested a tutor and I also asked my peers. A peer gave me a hint which helped me to udnerstand that I was using the correct coe, but that I had got something in the wrong order. Eventually, I identified that I had the console/log in the wrong place and this fixed the problem.


This entire assignment has been a challenge. Despite extensive research, hours of trial and error, I just didn't seem to be able to get any further with the task. I feel I have been hindered due to not having any prior practice of exploring such complex arrays in my studies; having limited exploration of mathematical concepts using Javascript; and by having a lack of statistical understanding. For example, I could not comprehend on my own how to idenitfy the average change in profit/losses over the entire period. Logically, I know I need to subtract each months total to find the difference. Then add each difference to get a total. I would then need to divide this total by 86.
